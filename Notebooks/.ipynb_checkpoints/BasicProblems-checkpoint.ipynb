    "- Write dispatches for `*(::LaplacianOperator,::Vector)`, `eltype(::LaplacianOperator)`, `size(::LaplacianOperator,d::Integer)`. \n",
    "- Write `least_square(::Operator,::Vector)` to solve the least-square approximation problem `Ax=b` for any operator. Note that since you do not have a matrix, you cannot use `\\` or factorizations like `qrfact`. Instead, take a look at `cg` in IterativeSolvers.jl\n",
