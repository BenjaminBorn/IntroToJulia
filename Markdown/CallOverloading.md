## Call Overloading

Call overloading is a fairly new feature to Julia. The idea is that a function is also just a type: it's a type which is "callable" 


```julia

```

## Project

Overload the call on the UnitStepRange to give an interpolated value at intermediate points, i.e. if `a=1:2:10`, then `a(1.5)=2`.
